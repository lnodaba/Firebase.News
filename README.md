# Firebase.News

It's a simple template project for the Firebase Labs it contains (hopefully) all the necessary samples,
based on them you will be able to create your very own project.
  
# Contains:
 
  - A newly created **.NET MVC** ( **API** template is also included) project, this project will be the **frontend of the application**
  - The template project contains an example for all the **CRUD** (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations 
  this includes the methods for the **controllers** and also the **views** for them. 
  You can find the dinosaur controller inside the controller folder and the associated views for them inside the Views/Dinosaur folder.
  
  - **Firebase.News.Tests** contains the Unit tests for the **public API** of the third party libraries we're going to use during the labs. 
  Namely : **FirebaseDatabase.net, FirebaseStorage.net and FirebaseAuthentication.net**
